# Template for a full-text request on ResearchGate

Dear XXX,

First of all, thank you for your interest in my work!

I do not upload my work to ResearchGate because it is often illegal to do so since they are a for-profit organization. Furthermore, they have the practice of sometimes inserting an extra page advertising their site into the uploaded PDFs. I find this unacceptable.

I keep a copy of all my work on my website: https://www.santisoler.com

There you will also find links to related works and other resources like source code, presentations, data, etc.

The paper you have asked for is at: https://www.santisoler.com/publications/

*Optional*:
The article you have requested is open-access (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access) and can also be freely downloaded from the publishers site: XXX

A free open-access preprint (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) is also available at: XXX


Best regards,


Santiago
